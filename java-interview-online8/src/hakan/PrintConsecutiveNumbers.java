/**
Write a function that, given a positive integer N, prints the consecutive 
numbers from 1 to N, each on a separate line. 

However, any number divisible by 2, 3 or 5 should be replaced by the word 
Codility, Test, or Coders respectively. 

If a number is divisible by more than one of the numbers: 2,3 or 5, 
it should be replaced by a concatenation of the respective words Codility, 
Test and Coders in this given order. 

For example, numbers divisible by both 2 and 3 should be replaced by 
CodilityTest and numbers divisible by all three numbers: 2,3 and 5, 
should be replaced by CodilityTestCoders.
